_A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how devices communicate with each other. Protocols specify how data is structured, sent, received, and processed, enabling efficient, secure, and organized communication between different devices and systems._

### **Examples of Common Protocols:**

1. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):**
    
    - The foundational protocol suite for the internet. TCP/IP governs how data is transmitted across networks and ensures reliable communication by breaking data into packets.

2. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**
    
    - Used for transferring web pages on the internet. It defines how web browsers and servers communicate to request and deliver web content.
    - It uses port 80.

3. **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):**
    
    - An encrypted version of HTTP, ensuring secure communication between web browsers and servers by using SSL/TLS encryption.
    - It uses port 443.

4. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**
    
    - Used for transferring files between computers on a network. FTP defines how files are uploaded or downloaded from servers.
    - It uses port 20 and 21.

5. **DNS (Domain Name System):**
    
    - Resolves domain names (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) to IP addresses. DNS allows users to access websites using human-readable names rather than numeric IP addresses.

6. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):**
    
    - Used for sending and relaying email messages between servers. SMTP defines the rules for how emails are transmitted from one server to another.

7. **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) & POP3 (Post Office Protocol):**
    
    - Protocols for receiving email. IMAP allows users to access and manage email on a mail server, while POP3 downloads emails to the user's device and removes them from the server.

8. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):**
    
    - Used to assign IP addresses dynamically to devices on a network, simplifying network management.

9. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):**
    
    - Used for monitoring and managing devices on a network, such as routers, switches, and servers, by collecting data about their status and performance.
