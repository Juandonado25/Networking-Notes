A MAC address is a physical address that identifies a [[NIC (Network Interface Card)]] in a network. It is unique for each device and is embedded in the hardware component. A MAC address consists of 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits (12 characters in total), typically separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., **00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E**). Although it is stored in the internal memory of the NiC, it can be modified using specific software, a process known as MAC spoofing.
