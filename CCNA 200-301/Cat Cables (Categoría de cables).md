Cat cables are a type of twisted pair cables used for Ethernet and other networking technologies. Each category specifies the cable's performance in terms of bandwidth and data transfer speed. The most common categories include:_

- **Cat5:**
    
    - Bandwidth: Up to 100 MHz.
    - Maximum speed: 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet).
    - Limited to 100 meters (328 feet).
- **Cat5e (Enhanced):**
    
    - Bandwidth: Up to 100 MHz.
    - Maximum speed: Up to 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet).
    - Improved resistance to crosstalk compared to Cat5.
- **Cat6:**
    
    - Bandwidth: Up to 250 MHz.
    - Maximum speed: Up to 10 Gbps for short distances (55 meters).
    - Better shielding and performance than Cat5e.
- **Cat6a (Augmented):**
    
    - Bandwidth: Up to 500 MHz.
    - Maximum speed: 10 Gbps (up to 100 meters).
- **Cat7:**
    
    - Bandwidth: Up to 600 MHz.
    - Maximum speed: 10 Gbps.
    - Includes additional shielding for reduced interference.
- **Cat8:**
    
    - Bandwidth: Up to 2000 MHz.
    - Maximum speed: Up to 40 Gbps for short distances (30 meters).
    - Designed for data centers and high-speed connections.
