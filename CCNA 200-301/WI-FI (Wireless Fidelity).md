It is a wireless technology that allows a group of devices to connect to each other through the air using radio waves.

It requires an access pint, such as a router, which sends radio frequency waves on specific channels like 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.

WI-FI operates using IEEE standards, such as:
- **802.11n:** Supports speeds up to 600 Mbps.
- **802.11ac:** Supports speeds up to 1 Gbps.
- **802.11ax (WI-FI 6):** Improves efficiency and capacity for modern devices.

For security, it uses [[Protocol]]s like WPA2 or WPA3 which encrypt the transmitted information.
